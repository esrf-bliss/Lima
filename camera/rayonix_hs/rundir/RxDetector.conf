#Configuration file for the craydl library
#
# By default this is found as "RxDetector.conf" in the current working directory, 
# but the name of the configuration file can be specified as an argument to the RxDetector constructor
#
# The program reading this configuration files will be looking for the values of entries within sections.
# In documentation, all entries will be qualified by their section name as Section/Entry  (eg. Detector/DetectorName )
#
# Syntax:
#
# All names (sections, entries, or string values) are case sensitive
#
# - Sections are introduced with a section name enclosed in square brackets  ( eg. [ Section ] )
# - Entries consist of an entry name, and equals sign, and a value or list of values (eg. Entry = 3  or Entry2 = 1 2 3 4 )
# - Values may be strings, integers, real numbers, or boolean 
#     Boolean values may be of the form  true/false, yes/no, t/f, y/n, on/off or integers where positive values indicate true
#     Any unrecognised string will be interpreted as false.
# - Comments are introduced with the '#' character and may be an entire line, or may follow an entry on the same line
#   Examples:
#      # This is a comment
#      Entry = 3 # This is also a comment, following a valid entry
#
# RxDetector will look for entries in the following sections. The order of sections listed here indicates precedence
# [ Custom ]           # Customized parameters for a particular site and/or installation - These take precedence over other sections
# [ craydl ]           # Library specific configuration information
# [ "detector name" ]  # Detector configuration for a specific detector, usually named in the [ Detector ] section
# [ Detector ]         # Detector parameters for the detector - a particular detector can also be specified here
#
#    Detector/DetectorName is a special entry that indicates a specific section where more specific entries may be found for this detector
#    The appearance of this entry will cause the program to look first in the "DetectorName" section for Detector entries before looking for those
#    entries in the Detector section.  A specific detector name may also be supplied to the library when the device is opened. That name will
#    override the Detector/DetectorName entry in this file.
#    Example
#    [ Detector ]
#    DetectorName = Detector3
#    DeviceName = /dev/generic
#
#    [ Detector3 ]
#    DeviceName = /dev/special
#
#    In the example, the DeviceName used will be /dev/special, because the Detector3 entries will supercede entries in the Detector section.
