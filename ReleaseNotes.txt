--------------------------------------------

Conda

To install the conda packages and since lima 1.9.8 the conda-forge channel must be set as the main one:
  * https://lima1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_install.html#install-binary-packages

New features

  * RoiCollection new processlib sinktask now available
  * RoiCollection and RoiCounter accept a overflow threshold value to cut off randomly defective pixel

Bug fixes

  * CtBuffer: An overflow on the max number of buffer

Camera updates

  * Dhyana v1.9.1
    * Hw Roi do not check supported camera Roi
      The Dhyana 95 camera only support X offset as multiple of 4 and width (X) as multiple of 8

      * Few fixes as well, the pixelsize in meter now, the firmware version is a string.
      * Manage the cold start and take a fake acquisition, otherwise the detector does not start on the first trigger.
      * set the trigger mode in prepareAcq
    * prepareAcq must not start the acquisition
    * Some refactoring needed to move the start of the acquisition to startAcq and only prepare buffer or acquisition parameters like trigger mode in prepareAcq

    created one passed to HwInterface the other kept internally in Camera object
  * basler: basler-1.7.2,  fixed monochrome vs. color mode
  * basler: basler.-1.7.1, fixed bug introduced in 1.7.0 for Roi increments

  * tango: server with new saving statistics and with abort command
  * basler: for color camera added yuv422packed video format
  
  * saving header: add acquisiton and images parameters
  
  * saving: added statistics.    
    We can now have saving, compression and incoming speed statistics
    changing cbf,edf,fits,hdf5,nxs and tiff to manage statistics
    
  * software operation: add possibility to force a copy for the first operation 
    internals operation are normally done in place but it's not always
    safe with some type of memory.
    i.e: You can not memove on a memory map, this cause a crash.

  * saving: we can now write severals frames in parallel.
    To control saving concurrency, you have to change the number of writing task
    with method get/setMaxConcurrentWritingTask.
    This commit contains also a small fix for write statistics:
    As we recreate the container when changing saving type, thoses parameters
    were not keeped.
    We now set event callback in case of error when writing.
    
  * saving cbf: compession optimisation with CBFMiniHeader format.    
    For now is only available for INT 32 images.
  * control: added abort acquisition method
