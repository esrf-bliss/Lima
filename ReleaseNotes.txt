                has been repaired, and can be use now to have faster software acquisition sequence
     * New Features:
       Tango: new properties to run the server on a slave computer, not only on the DCU computer:
         - tmpfs_path. default = /lima_data
         - host_name, default = localhost
         - host_port, default = 41234

    parallax free observation of micrometer sized crystals. It is optimized for MX crystallography
    beamlines and high throughput stations in Synchrotrons.

     file path and creation date.
   * adjust the image dataset size to the number of acquired frames
   * in manual saving, keep a contiguous frame dataset

   getSupportedVideoMode() and getMode().

core-1.7.1 2017-01-06
Features
  * new tag 1.7.0 for cameras: andor/andor3/basler/dexela/espia/frelon/
    maxipix/perkinelmer/pixirad/pointgrey/prosilica/roperscientific/simulator/
    ueye/v4l2/xh

Bug Fixes
  * maxipix: maxipix-1.7.1, Fixed for setFillMode, 2 reconstructionTask objects
    created one passed to HwInterface the other kept internally in Camera object
  * basler: basler-1.7.2,  fixed monochrome vs. color mode
  * basler: basler.-1.7.1, fixed bug introduced in 1.7.0 for Roi increments
  * saving cbf: fixed Makefile + bison parser generation
    New patch version just for CBF compilation

core-1.7.0 2017-04-01
Features
  * Makefile: Improve Makefile library dependency definitions for parallel build
  * tango: server with new saving statistics and with abort command
  * basler: for color camera added yuv422packed video format
  
  * saving header: add acquisiton and images parameters
  
  * saving: added statistics.    
    We can now have saving, compression and incoming speed statistics
    changing cbf,edf,fits,hdf5,nxs and tiff to manage statistics
    
  * software operation: add possibility to force a copy for the first operation 
    internals operation are normally done in place but it's not always
    safe with some type of memory.
    i.e: You can not memove on a memory map, this cause a crash.

  * saving: we can now write severals frames in parallel.
    To control saving concurrency, you have to change the number of writing task
    with method get/setMaxConcurrentWritingTask.
    This commit contains also a small fix for write statistics:
    As we recreate the container when changing saving type, thoses parameters
    were not keeped.
    We now set event callback in case of error when writing.
    
  * saving cbf: compession optimisation with CBFMiniHeader format.    
    For now is only available for INT 32 images.
  * control: added abort acquisition method
  * basler: Pylon5 support and find proper pylon link flags

Bug Fixes
  * video: fixed synchro to image when changing video mode.
      - WARNING: only applied when live is started on already running
  * saving cbf: fixed a bug in cbf header
  * image: fixed roi when software operation is activated (rotation,flip...)
